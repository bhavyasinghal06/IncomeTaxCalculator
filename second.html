<h2>How income tax is calculated</h2>
<p>Basically income tax is applicable on total taxable income(Basic salary + HRA + Special Allowance +Other sources of income).Basic reduction of 50,000 and some exemptions are also applicabe such as in HRA,etc.Some deductions from total taxable income are also allowed.For eg.80C(Max-1.5 lacs)(PPF deposit ,ELSS investments, LIC premium,EPF deducted by employer), 80D(Max-Rs 25,000 for self Rs 50,000 for parents)(Medical insurance premium), 80TTA(Max-10,000)(	Savings account interest)</p>

<p>The easiest way to calculate your tax liability is through an online income tax calculator. However, it can be done manually as well.</p>
<p>Let us consider the example of Mr. Dutta whose earnings include a basic salary of <strong>Rs.37,500 per month (i.e., Rs.4.5 lakh per annum) </strong>in the financial year 2019-2020.</p>
<ul>
   <li>His salary also include House Rent Allowance</a> (HRA) of Rs.20,000 per month or Rs.2.4 lakh per year.</li>
   <li>The Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) is Rs.15,000 on an annual basis.</li>
   <li>There is also a special allowance component of Rs.10,000 per month (i.e., Rs.1.2 lakh per year).</li>
   <li>Mr. Dutta stays in Kolkata and pays rent of Rs.15,000 per month, which amounts to Rs.1.80 lakh per year.</li>
   <li> There is also an EPF</a> component (Mr.Dutta’s share) that is deducted from his salary per month. This is equivalent to 12% of his basic salary on a monthly basis, i.e., Rs.(37,500 * 0.12) = Rs.4,500. On an annual scale this will amount to Rs.54,000.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 1: Calculation of Taxable HRA</h2>
<p>The first step is to identify the HRA chargeable to tax.</p>

<ul>
   
   <li>
      <em>HRA received on an annual basis =</em><em><strong> Rs.2.4 lakh</strong></em>
   </li>
   <li>
      <em>Rent that is paid in excess of 10% of annual basic salary = Rs.(1.8 lakh - (0.1 * 4.5 lakh)) = </em><em><strong>Rs.1.35 lakh</strong></em>
   </li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Hence, the total taxable HRA = Rs.2.4 lakh – Rs.1.35 lakh = Rs.1.05 lakh</strong></em></p>
<h2>Step 2: Calculation of Taxable Income from Salary</h2>
<p>The annual gross income from his salary is outlined in the table below:</p>

<p>*Standard deduction was proposed to be Rs.40,000 in the Union Budget 2018. In the Interim Budget of 2019, it was increased to Rs.50,000.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Calculation of Total Deductions</h2>
<p>Now let us take a look at the investments made by Mr. Dutta.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Calculation of Income Tax Liability</h2>
